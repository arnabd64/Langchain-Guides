        "5. Creative Writing Tools\n",
        "\n",
        "This notebook deals with the absolute basics to get started with Langchain on python. Since the framework requires a large language model for it's operation. First step would be to get setup a Large Language Model for yourself. I strongly suggest using any of the following services but there are several more integrations available.\n",

        "1. [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com):This is a paid service by OpenAI which gives you access to models like GPT-3.5,. GPT-4o and GPT-4\n",
