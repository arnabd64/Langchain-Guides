        "[Langchain](https://python.langchain.com/v0.2/docs/introduction/) is a framework for developing applications that are driven by Large Language Models. It can be used to develop applications like:\n",

        "5. Creative Writing Tools\n",
        "\n",
        "This notebook deals with the absolute basics to get started with Langchain on python. Since the framework requires a large language model for it's operation. First step would be to get setup a Large Language Model for yourself. I strongly suggest using any of the following services but there are several more integrations available.\n",
